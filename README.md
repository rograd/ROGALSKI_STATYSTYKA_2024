# Project Overview

- The classifier implementation along with its accuracy check is inside the `main` notebook.
- The data analysis part is inside the `data_analysis` notebook.
- Every step is described inside each notebook.
- In order to run this code, you must set up a virtual environment and install the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. Here are the steps:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source env/bin/activate

# Install the required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Then the code can be run directly from the notebook file.
